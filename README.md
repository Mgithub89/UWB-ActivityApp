## About the Project
This was the first group project for the UW Coding Bootcamp. For this project we were simply given a set of requirements that our application needed to meet, but we were given creative control over the design and functionality of the application. Among the criteria were: being interactive, using at least two APIs, using a CSS framework other than Bootstrap, and using client-side storage to store persistent data.
Our group chose to make an application named !Bored. This application would access your current location and pull the current weather data. Based on the weather data, the application would recommend that you do an indoor or outdoor activity. The application pulls local events from a Ticketmaster API and presents those to the user. It also pulls local Points of Interest from Triposo. The user then has the option to save these events or points of interest for access later.

## Benefits of This Project
This project taught us a lot about working with a team. From the start, we were able to work well together to develop a concept. We bounced ideas off of one another, developed on favorite themes, and were honest about the challenges that certain ideas would present.

Sharing a GitHub repository was definitely a learning curve. Being able to successfully navigate the various branches, issues, and pull requests took some time to get used to. We are all very thankful for this opportunity to practice with this incredibly useful tool. 

This project also gave us a lot more experience in working with APIs. We had come up with our concept, and needed to find the necessary APIs to make our vision work. This took a lot of Googling, trial and error, and hours of reading through API documentation. When we finally found an API that would work for our goal, it was an amazing feeling.
